                                className="subtitle font-weight-light ">If we have a dispute,
                                we will submit our dispute for resolution by arbitration before the AAA in the state of Nevada.
                                If either party files for arbitration, it will be conducted in accordance with the then current
                                AAA Commercial Arbitration Rules. The arbitrator will have exclusive authority to resolve any
                                dispute including any claim related to your use of the Website, or any of our services. If
                                either party proceeds to arbitration, each party will pay its own AAA filing, administration and
                                arbitrator fees unless the arbitrator determines that a party’s claim is frivolous or brought
                                for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil
                                Procedure 11(b)), in which case the party submitting such claim shall pay for all filing,
                                administration and arbitrator fees. For claims brought by you of Ten Thousand Dollars
                                ($10,000.00) or less, you can choose whether the arbitration proceeds in person, by telephone or
                                based only on submissions. The arbitrator may award any form of individual or equitable relief,
                                including injunctive relief. Any award will be final and conclusive to the parties and may be
                                entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. Each party agrees that the arbitration
                                proceedings and results of such proceedings shall be kept confidential. This provision shall not
                                be construed to preclude any party from seeking injunctive relief in a court of competent
                                jurisdiction to protect its rights pending an outcome in arbitration.</p><p
